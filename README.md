# PQ-Calculator

P,Q-formula calculator program using C++

## Purpose

The purpose of design this C++ program was to calculate P and Q in javascript/web applications, but since JS performance is not much good for a huge computation. we prefer to prepare a C++ program and use a PHP script to run that binary program.

By the way, you are able to calculate the p and q by the highest speed and performance.
Enjoy it!

## Features

- `int 128` support
- C++ Performance
- Without using third party library (Only C++)
- Cross-platform (Support Windows and Linux)
- PHP script if you want to use P, Q in your client applications or server

## Using


**Linux**:

```
$ bash make.sh
```

**Windows**:

```
$ makewin.sh
```

Or only run `php pq.php` in your terminal or inside a webservice by Browser/URL.

## Where we can use this P and Q program?

We already used this C++ program inside the Telegram web application.
